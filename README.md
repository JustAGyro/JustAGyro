### Hi there my name is Kamran Qureshi

## Background Information
- I am full-stack software engineer based out of New York. I was previously an Accountant that wanted to find a career path that offered a fresh new challenge to conquer. Throughout my career I have always sought out the path that felt most interesting even if it often meant longer hours and a few headaches on the way. I strive to always challenge my self and if I ever feel too comfortable I make sure I can get out of my comfort zone to push my self again. This career path has lead me to meet a plethora of intersting people from all backgrounds and learn so much more than I ever expected. I can't wait to continue this journey and hopefully you'll be apart of it!

## More about me:

- I am currently working on my PokeMeta project and plan on introducing more fun and exciting features for all users in the upcoming months.
- I am currently learning TypeScript as well as Swift to branch out from my foundation of JavaScript and Python.
- Fun Fact: When I got my first job in accounting I had only ever taken 1 accounting class, and I did not do well in that class! Goes to show that any plan can have unintended occurances and you have to make the most of what you get!

## Hobbies 

- My hobbies include gaming, hiking, exploring the city, cooking (as well as visiting restaurants), and recently I have tried to get into baking. 
- I have two cats Taro and Loki.
